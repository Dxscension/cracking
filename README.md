# Cracking
## What is this?

This rep is made only for private purposes, to crack key systems, whitelists or any other made inside of roblox, I will put here helpful files for specific cracks, but im not going to release the whole crack since it might get patched.

## THIS REP IS NOT:
- **NOT** teaching anyone how to do it.
- **NOT** releasing cracks for everyone.
- **NOT** showing anyone methods to crack.
- **NOT** skidding of sources, it's a mod to encryptions or files for spoofing. (it's mostly a modified fork for spoofing.)

## THIS REP IS FOR:
>Personal cracks, to share with **MY** friends, explain **CERTAIN** people or any other.
> Show possible vulnerabilities on free/paid services.
>Being private, duh. I don't want anyone to just go and copy code to bypass a whitelist or key system.

.
If I want this private, then why publishing it on github?
I want certain people that has my github name or the rep link see the files. Being on github is not private at all, but is a good website to publish some stuff for a certain community.

## Development

Want to contribute?
I don't know every vulnerability out there, also I **can't** crack everything, so  if you want to show me errors on optimization, more cracks that you have made and others, I would greattly appreciate it.
